## Codecs
### Lossless
#### JPEG XS
- [JPEGXS](https://jpeg.org/jpegxs/) ([Specification](https://ds.jpeg.org/whitepapers/jpeg-xs-whitepaper.pdf)) - The JPEG XS (ISO/IEC 21122) standard specifies a compression technology with an end-to-end latency of a few lines, at a low implementation complexity.
- [Introduction to the New JPEG XS Standard for Low-Latency, Visually Lossless Streaming in HD, 4K, and 8K](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s31734/) by Jean-Baptiste Lorent.
- FFmpeg - A cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. Supports SMPTE ST 2110.

### Lossy

### Transport Streams
#### CBR
#### Piecewise VBR
A piecewise constant VBR transport stream can only vary at the PCRs of the program under consideration per ISO/IEC 13818-1:2007 § 2.4.2.2.
#### Non-piecewise VBR:
A non-piecewise constant VBR transport stream has no predictable time base to reconstruct the signal if the inter-packet timing is altered in transit through the network.
## High Bit Rate Media Transport (HBRMT)
> Formerly known as High Bit Rate Audio Video Over IP (HBRAV-IP)

Standard for data encapsulation and forward error correction (FEC) of high bit rate contribution oriented video/audio feed services, up to 3 Gbit/s over Ethernet networks. HBRMT is published as parts 5 and 6 of SMPTE 2022 by the [SMPTE 32NF networking technology committee](https://web.archive.org/web/20110125153532/http://www.videoservicesforum.org/SMPTE_32NF_Tech_Com.shtml). HBRMT supports both SDI uncompressed and JPEG 2000 compressed video and audio formats.

## Standards
### SMTPE ST 2022
The SMPTE ST 2022 suite of standards provides a reliable way of using IP to transmit signals that were traditionally sent over serial interfaces.

> To read more about every part of the SMPTE ST 2022 standard, head to [standards/SMPTE-ST-2022.md](standards/SMPTE-ST-2022.md)

- [smpte2110-analyzer](https://github.com/ebu/smpte2110-analyzer): Analyzer to inspect network packets generated by the SMPTE ST 2110 specification.

### SMPTE ST 2110
The SMPTE ST 2110 suite of standards specifies the carriage, synchronization, and description of separate elementary essence streams over IP for real-time media applications.
